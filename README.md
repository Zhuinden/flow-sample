# flow-sample
Flow-Sample by Square

This used to be the exact same flow-sample as what was originally in the square/flow repository. [But that has since been removed as it was a "bad sample"](https://github.com/square/flow/commit/3ffb3f9f3cd1649d431146530f19394e9d0850bf). However, it is also the only public working implementation of a master-detail arrangement using Flow. So I ripped it out of their deletion commit and posted it here instead.

On 2017.02.07, this repository was converted to use Simple-Stack, Dagger2, and ButterKnife 8.x. 

The original Flow sample is still available among the releases.
